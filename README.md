# recursive-link-scraper
Makes a collection of all links on a page, searches those links and adds each of those page's links to the collection, and so on forever.

_Note to Dr. Reynolds:_  
`fa.html` _is the only link missing from the pattern, but it is not linked to in any other page on your site._
